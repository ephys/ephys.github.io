## Who am I?

Hi I'm **Zo√©**

I'm a deeply **passionate developer** who continuously strives to be better at both who I am and what I'm doing.

I strive to do my part in creating a **fast**, and **accessible** World Wide Web.  
I really enjoy finding new, automated, optimizations to make my apps faster.

Currently, my language of predilection is **JavaScript**. I am also very enthusiast about other
web technologies such as the DOM, HTML, CSS and the gazillion of other specs.

I love discovering new technologies and keeping myself **up to date** with (and sometimes a bit ahead of) 
the tech of our industry by actively reading (and writing too!) the TC39 (ECMAScript), WHATWG (HTML), and W3C (CSS) githubs and mailing lists.
I love the open source community and [try to give back when I can](https://github.com/Ephys).

I've worked on and with community-produced tech such as **React, Webpack, SCSS, PostCSS, Babel, Gatsby, PHP, Wordpress, PostgreSQL, MySQL** (others too but they're not as used anymore).
