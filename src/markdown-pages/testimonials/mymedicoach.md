"Precise and effective work, Zoé is reactive and takes to heart delivering a *product that meets my expectations*. Zoé knows how to put himself in my shoes when explaining the impact my decisions have on the development of the application, which helps me prioritise. She is always ready to shine light on any decision, be it related to business, user experience, design, or purely technical. She knows how to get down to my level so that I understand the technical aspects."
