The gender unicorn is a website created for the [<abbr title="Trans Student Educational Resources">TSER</abbr>](http://www.transstudent.org/). 
It is a recreation of their [Gender Unicorn infographic](http://www.transstudent.org/gender) as an interactive, printable, and mobile friendly version.

This project was incredibly fun, and a great opportunity to learn how to adapt a design for a different medium, 
while trying to stay true to the source material.
